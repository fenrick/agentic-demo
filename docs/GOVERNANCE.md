## 3. Policies and Standards

### 3.1 Change Management

1. **Change Request**: Documented in Jira with description, rationale, impact analysis, rollback plan.
2. **Review**: Engineering, DevSecOps, QA, and Compliance leads review and approve in Change Advisory Board (CAB).
3. **Testing**: All changes must pass CI/CD pipelines, including unit, integration, security, and performance tests.
4. **Deployment**: Staged rollout via blue-green or canary deployments; monitor metrics for anomalies.
5. **Rollback**: If SLOs breach or critical errors occur, trigger automated rollback and incident response.

### 3.2 Release Management

* **Release Cadence**: Bi-weekly feature releases; monthly security and compliance patches.
* **Release Artifacts**: Release notes, migration scripts, updated documentation.
* **Approval Gate**: Product Owner and Compliance Officer sign-off before production deployment.

### 3.3 Incident Management

1. **Detection**: Alerts from Prometheus/Grafana for SLO breaches, errors, or security events.
2. **Triage**: SRE on-call acknowledges within 15 minutes, classifies severity (P1–P4).
3. **Response**: Follow runbooks in `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`; communicate status via incident channel.
4. **Resolution**: Restore service to SLO levels, conduct root cause analysis.
5. **Postmortem**: Completed within 72 hours, including action items and owners; reviewed by Audit Committee.

### 3.4 Audit & Compliance

* **Internal Audits**: Quarterly reviews of access logs, configuration drift, and compliance checklists.
* **External Audits**: Annual third-party audit for ISO 27001 and Privacy Act compliance.
* **Audit Logs**: Immutable logs of `action_log`, configuration changes, and user access; retained 1 year.

### 3.5 Data Governance

* **Data Ownership**: Product Owner owns definition and retention policies; Data Governance Lead enforces.
* **Retention Policies**: Snapshots—last 50 versions; logs—30 days; cache—7 days.
* **Data Access**: Role-based access; least privilege enforced via FastAPI RBAC.
* **Data Quality**: Periodic validation of citations and content integrity via automated checks.

## 4. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) & Metrics

| SLO Category            | Objective                                         | Metric                 | Threshold                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Availability**        | Service endpoints available                       | Uptime %               | ≥ 99.5% monthly          |
| **Performance**         | Prompt-to-first-stream latency                    | P95 latency            | < 2s under 50 concurrent |
| **Correctness**         | Fact-check failure rate                           | unsupported-claim rate | < 2%                     |
| **Quality**             | Pedagogy critic pass rate                         | Bloom coverage score   | ≥ 90%                    |
| **Security**            | Critical vulnerability count                      | # of CVEs              | 0                        |
| **Change Success Rate** | Deployments without rollback after canary release | % successful releases  | ≥ 95%                    |

**Monitoring**: Metrics emitted to Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. Alerts configured at 10–20% buffer below thresholds.

| R3 | Performance degradation under peak load        | Medium | Medium     | SRE Lead           | Autoscaling policies, load tests   |
| R4 | Non-compliance with new privacy regulation     | High   | Low        | Compliance Officer | Policy reviews, impact assessments |

### 6.2 Risk Review

* **Change Control**:

  * All document edits via pull requests.
  * Changes to governance require approval by Audit Committee.
  * Versioning of documents tracked in Git; release tags align with software releases.
